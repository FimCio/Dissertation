\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:if_you_use_this_template}

In software development, developers and software engineers are not only responsible for implementing new software requirements but must also address bugs. Bugs are errors in the software code that make it unreliable, often leading to serious issues. Software bugs costs companies over 45\% of the budget \cite{Xuan2015}. Nearly 70\% of the developers time is spent debugging \cite{Minelli2015}.

One crucial step in the software development process is Software Bug Triage (SBT). The evaluation of each problem report's severity, priority, and relevance to the developer's competence has historically been done manually, which takes a lot of time and experience. Manual triaging has grown to be a bottleneck due to the complexity and volume of software projects, which can cause delays in problem fixes and even lower software quality. 

By taking factors like developer experience, workload, and past performance, the incorporation of machine learning and artificial intelligence (ML) into bug triage not only speeds up the assignment process but also improves accuracy. This technical progress is essential for handling the increasing demands of contemporary software development, guaranteeing prompt and efficient bug fixes, and upholding strict software quality standards.

Delays and unsolved software bugs can lead to serious and very expensive issues. In 1996, for instance, the European Space Agency's Ariane 5 rocket, which was worth around \$370 million, was destroyed 36 seconds after liftoff because of a software error \cite{Ariane5}. The Consortium for IT Software Quality (CISQ) estimates that only in 2020, software problems cost the US over \$2.08 trillion.
